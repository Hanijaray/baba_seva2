  <h1 style="text-align: center;">Welcome Brothers/Sisters ❤️</h1>
  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Let's see why we worship Lord Shiva as Shivling</h2>

  <p>When we say Lord Shiva, what often comes to mind is a person with a trident, snake around his neck, and tiger skin attire...</p>

  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Okay, why is this person worshipped as Shivling?</h2>

  <p>Actually, Lord Shiva is a soul (<b>Param Aatma</b>). We are also souls, not this body!</p>
  <p>Shiva is the Father of all souls.</p>

  <h2>Christians say God the Father (Param Pitha), Muslims say Allah (as a point of light)—that is none other than the <b>Supreme Soul</b>.</h2>

  <p class="highlight"><b>THERE IS ONLY ONE GOD WHO HAS MANY NAMES.</b></p>

  <p>Why we worship Param Aatma (Shiva) as Shivling: Shiva's devotees perform daily poojas—abhishekam, deepa aarti, etc. For these rituals,
    they construct a Shivling assuming its oval shape represents the soul. Souls (like us) are a point of light. Our God is also a point of light.
    For devotional purposes, the symbolic form is made larger—that's why we worship Shiva as Shivling.</p>

  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Then you may wonder—who is the one with the snake and damru?</h2>

    <img src="image/sankar.jpg" alt="Sankar" title="Sankar" width="400">

  <p>This is Sankar—not Shiva. Why do we call him Shiva then? Because Sankar was a deep devotee of Lord Shiva, and people mistakenly assumed he was Shiva himself.</p>

  <p><b>Just think—if Sankar is God, then who is he remembering in meditation? God, right?</b> For meditation, we remember God. Sankar meditates on Lord Shiva as a point of light (soul) and practices Raja Yoga. We've misunderstood and started worshipping Sankar as Shivling.</p>

  <p>Just like Sankar, we too should remember God as a point of light in a golden-orange sky (<i>Parandhamam</i>—the abode of God). Doing so helps us stay in <b>Soul Consciousness</b>. When we're in Soul Consciousness, we avoid vices like <b>Lust, Anger, Attachment, Greed, Arrogance</b>.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>We're in Kaliyug, an age of sorrow. God gives this knowledge to his beloved children so they can become free from sorrow.</p>

  <p>By remembering God as the Soul, we can transcend Kaliyug and move toward <b>Mukti Dham</b> (liberation) and enter the <b>Upcoming Satyug</b> (Golden Age).</p>
